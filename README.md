# Newfoundland Fighting Jam

This repo contains the code for the Newfoundland Fighting Jam website, built with Vite and React. To get this sucker working locally, you're going to need to install Node, then run `npm install` in the base directory. Once that's done, use `npm run build` to build the site for hosting, or `npm run dev` to host it locally.
